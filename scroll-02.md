# Digital-Crafts Week II
Hello, Reader. I’m delighted you’ve returned to read of my travels with Digital Crafts. Luckily, my party has survived a second week of venture and I’m here to tell the tale.

## A Functional Funk
After a weekend’s rest, we decided to spend time cleaning up our code and happened upon “functions”. Functions allow us to run a set of code when called repeatedly. To create a function, we memorized the def keyword, name, parameter(s) and body. 

## The Objective 
As we continued our research, we learned about classes, methods, objects and instances — huge advantages against understanding the python.  I had a bit of trouble understanding how it made things simpler at first, but got a lot more practice after making a game of it. 

## The Spelling Nemesis
By the end of the week, our party felt ready, dividing into groups to finally take on the python. First, we had to take on mini-bosses guarding the serpent. My party was tasked with defeating the Spelling Nemesis, a keyboard warrior who protected the Python by ruining people’s ability to spell. With Otis, David, Daniel and I, we were able to defeat the Spelling Nemesis with a magnificent mixture of newly learned code, music and aesthetics. It was a load of fun, and we got a ton of new experience. 

Now to gather and prepare for the real battle…

This week was great. Had a lot of fun and feel like I have a great understanding in the basics of Python. So proud of my team!
