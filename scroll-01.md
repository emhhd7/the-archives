# Digital-Crafts Week I
Hello, Reader. Upon writing this, I, Erin the Student, am completing my first week with Digital Crafts. I took on this journey with a bit of knowledge in CSS, HTML and Javascript, and find myself excited for the new roads ahead. Our party is filled with a wide-range of skills, personalities, fandoms and interests, and I am honored to be traveling with such a wonderful group.

## The Command Slime
After we introduced ourselves, we immediately took on our first quest. We were to find the 'command line' within our machines and complete a series of tasks to create, copy, move and remove directories and files. I learned about the syntax, 'cp' and 'mv', and spent time reviewing what I'd learned from past experience. 

## gitHuBEAST
Once we got to know the Command Line, we spent time learning about gitHub and Nano. Nano is a simple notepad that you can type in, while gitHub keeps track of file changes and backups once you load in a repository. Commonly used git syntax includes status, add, commit, push, fetch, pull, branch, checkout, clone and log. We also learned about keys.


## The Punctual Python
By the end of the week, we got our feet soaked with Python. We learned about strings, integers, conditionals, comments, methods, concatenation, index, loops, lists, dictionary and a TON of syntax. I realized a lot of it was similar to Javascript, but Python is more particular about punctuation and indentation. My favorite exercise was creating the list of numbers and figuring out different ways to manipulate the data inside of it with For statements. It was a great challenge away from using methods such as min and max. I had fun problem-solving as a team.

### tldr;
In short, this week was really enjoyable for me. I love working with command-line, github and python, and am confident that I can explain my solutions and help my peers where needed. I look forward to more adventures with code in the coming weeks.
